# OBSTACLE-AVOIDING-ROBOT
AIM: 
The aim of the obstacle avoiding robot is to navigate autonomously in an unstructured environment while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The robot must be able to accurately detect and localize obstacles in its vicinity, and implement a control strategy to safely maneuver around them. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust and efficient robotic system that can perform obstacle avoidance tasks in various scenarios, such as in industrial settings, warehouses, and outdoor environments. Such a system can improve productivity, reduce the risk of accidents, and enhance the overall safety and efficiency of autonomous robotic systems.

Methodology Used: 
The methodology used for an obstacle avoiding robot involves the following steps:
1.	Sensor Selection: Selecting appropriate sensors to detect obstacles in the robot's surroundings. Typically, ultrasonic, infrared, or laser sensors are used for this purpose.
   
2.	Sensor Fusion: Combining the sensor data from multiple sensors to get an accurate and reliable estimate of the obstacle's location and distance.

3.	Control Strategy: Developing a control strategy that allows the robot to reactively avoid obstacles in real-time. This may involve implementing a simple reactive control system or a more advanced planning and control strategy.

4.  Testing and Validation: Testing the robot in various environments to validate its performance and ensure that it can safely navigate through obstacles.

6.	Optimization: Optimizing the robot's performance by fine-tuning the control parameters, sensor configuration, and overall design.

7.	Integration: Integrating the obstacle avoidance system into a larger robotic system and interfacing it with other modules such as localization, mapping, and navigation.
